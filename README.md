PLEASE DO NOT SHOW THIS PORTFOLIO IN CLASS

K-pop has been rapidly gaining worldwide popularity in the last few years. However, it has been around since the 1990s and is often divided into generations: the 1st-gen (mid-1990s - early 2000s), the 2nd-gen (mid-2003 - late 2000s), the 3rd-gen (2011 - 2016) and the 4th-gen (2017 onwards).
I have composed a corpus that consists of songs from all four generations in order to find out how K-pop has evolved over the years. Is rising popularity due to a change in the music or simply a result of social media? 
I expect that K-pop is slowly shifting more and more towards Western music genres. However, every group has its own concept, so I am not sure whether the shift will be perfectly clear.

The corpus consists of Â±100 of the most popular songs from each generation. However, since K-pop has grown a lot there are less artists from the 1st-gen compared to the other ones, therefore this generation's songs may be biased towards some groups. Furthermore, there is not a clear line between the different generations, some even speak of generation 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5. Moreover, some artists from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations are still producing music. Therefore, the songs may belong to the 4th-gen whereas the artist is from the 1st-gen. A complicated example is the 2022 song 'Step back' from the group 'GOT the beat'. This group has members from all four generations, but the group itself is 4th-gen.

1st: 1-88 (88 liedjes)
2nd: 89-322 (134 liedjes)
3rd: 323-481 (159 liedjes)
4th: 482-607 (126 liedjes)
