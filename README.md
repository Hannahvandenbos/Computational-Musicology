## The Secret of a Popular Girl Group
In the Western music industry (US, UK) girl groups are not as common as in Asian music (K-pop, J-pop). Nonetheless, some of the most popular girl groups around the world can not only be found in Korea and Japan but also in the US and the UK. <br>
Based on the number of claimed total records, I have chosen four of the most popular girl groups, one from each of the aforementioned countries. These groups are the Spice Girls (UK), The Supremes (US), 2NE1 (KR) and AKB48 (JP). I have used the “This is ‘group name’ “ playlist for all groups, which consists of the greatest hits according to Spotify. I want to compare these playlists to figure out what it is that makes these groups so popular. What do they all have in common? What makes a group stand out?

I expect the girl groups to have quite powerful/happy songs in general. However, I am not sure about their unique features of a group that makes them stand out from the others.
I will also be looking at the track popularity, however this may not be the most reliable feature, since The Supremes were popular before Spotify was even invented. Therefore, their songs may appear less popular on Spotify than they actually are. <br>
Because I am using the “This is” playlists, I will not be including all songs of the groups. However, since I am only interested in their popularity, I think it makes sense to just include their greatest hits.
